PART 4: Claude Integration

Uses Claude API to:
1. Summarize FAERS narrative text into plain language
2. Generate clinical documentation notes

Two functions:
  - summarize_narrative_pattern(): Read patient stories, summarize patterns
  - generate_clinical_note(): Write doctor-ready documentation

2. When did the reaction typically start (if timing is mentioned)?
3. How severe does the reaction appear to be?
4. Does this look like a consistent pattern or scattered cases?

Be honest about data limitations. Do NOT invent details that aren't present in the sample.

Keep your response to 3-4 sentences maximum."""
